# COP4020
Haskell and Prolog :: UCF CS Programming Languages I

Not to be considered the best work that I've ever done; this is my first attempt at functional programming languages, including both Haskell and Prolog for my UCF CS COP4020 course during Spring 2016 semester.

**HW1:**  
1. Chess.hs
2. PolygonArea.hs
