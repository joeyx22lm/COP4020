# COP4020
Haskell and Prolog :: UCF CS Programming Languages I

Not to be considered the best work that I've ever done; this is my first attempt at functional programming languages, including both Haskell and Prolog for my UCF CS COP4020 course during Spring 2016 semester.

**HW1:**  
- Chess.hs
- PolygonArea.hs

**HW2:**  
- RegularExpressions.hs
- SimpleFunctions.hs

**HW3:**  
- SearchTree.hs
- Set.hs

**HW4:**  
- TreeLabelWithoutStateMonad.hs
- TreeLabelWithStateMonad.hs

** Nobody ever said that I got a 100% on any of these XD **
